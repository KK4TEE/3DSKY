# 3DSKY

![3DSKY](doc/img/3DSKY-Banner?raw=true "An openSCAD design along with a fully printed and assembled 3DSKY")

A 3D Kerbalized replica of NASA's [DSKY Apollo  Guidance Computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer).

This replica is designed to be printed in PLA on a commodity 3D printer. It features mounting screws for an [Arduino Uno or Mega](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arduino) compatible micro-controller, as well as 7segment displays, LEDs for equipment status, and [Cherry MX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_(keyboards)) compatible keyboard switches for user input. The rear of the box has cutouts for the micro-controller's USB and DC barrel power connector.

Please also refer to my [Control-Panel](https://github.com/KK4TEE/Control-Panel) project which provides an interface for the 3DSKY to interface with the [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com) video game. The python script telemachus_plugin.py was an early attempt at this, but has been superseded by [Control-Panel](https://github.com/KK4TEE/Control-Panel).

|DSKY-LED_LABELS.png is sized to fit into the space between the top cover and the top riser. You are welcome to adjust the image to show alternative status output with the LEDs.| ![LED Labels](DSKY-LED_LABELS.png)|
